# NYCSchoolData
- In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.
- I looked at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
- - This was carried ou on DataCamp https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/nyc_school_scores/guided/SQL
